# Cooking recipes

We cook almost every day, collecting recipes from a variety of sources and adjust them to meet our taste. This means we perform cooking experiments every day--we are very likely to fail at the beginning, learn from our experience, and make it better.

Therefore it comes to the idea: "Cook. Iterate. Share. Collaborate. Code."

We collect recipes and put it here in the repository. We iterate them by updating the details, such as a number for the weight of an ingredient, or we add notes if a mighty mite is missing.

We may also collaborate, if you find the idea is interesting ðŸ˜ƒ

Best regards, X
